# Emergency navigation system

In this project, we have considered the map of Noida, using Graphs Data Structures. We have taken 8 hospitals, and 3 warehouses where the Resources are stored.
Initially, the user would be asked for the hospitalâ€™s name, where the resources are required. Then, the programme would ask for what resources are required in that hospital. 
This is where the main objective of the code comes into play. Now, the programme would display the best possible route from the Warehouse to the Hospital. The Total Time taken for the resources to get delivered to their destined location would always be calculated and displayed. The time shown would also consider all the traffics on these routes.
